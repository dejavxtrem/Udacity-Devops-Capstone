# Udacity-Devops-Capstone




In this Capstone project i have applied the skills i learnt in the past months from the Udacity Devops Engineer nanodegree program.This nanodegree course provided us various tools and handson lab practices that will certainly help me to work with realtime project. I have learnt many things that i will continue to explore more and more to get more deeper insight about the topics i learnt.
